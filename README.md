# The-Gaming-Room
The Gaming Room asked me to help bring their popular Android game “Draw It or Lose It” to the web so it could be played on more devices and browsers. My role was to create a detailed design document that explained how the system would work from both a technical and user perspective. This included outlining the architecture, how users would interact with the game, and how to ensure the experience remained smooth and reliable across platforms.

I was especially good at breaking down complex technical details into clear, actionable goals. I made sure the document was well organized and easy to follow, even for team members who didn’t have a technical background. It became the central reference point for everyone on the project and helped keep development on track by giving the team a clear roadmap.

If I could improve one part, I would put more emphasis on optimizing performance. Since the game relies on real time multiplayer interaction, reducing lag and ensuring smooth gameplay across various network conditions is critical. In hindsight, I would include more specific strategies for improving responsiveness and managing latency, like using WebSockets efficiently, implementing predictive client-side updates, or offloading heavier tasks to background threads.

Understanding user needs played a huge role throughout the process. I spent time reviewing client feedback, analyzing player behavior from the original app, and identifying areas that needed improvement in the web version. That helped guide decisions about user interface design, browser compatibility, and how to maintain the fast-paced engaging feel of the original game.

When I design software, I start by figuring out what the users need and what the app is supposed to do. Then I make a simple list of features it should have and break the big problem into smaller parts. I sketch out a basic plan of how the pieces will work together like how the front end talks to the back end, or how data is stored. I keep things organized and think ahead so it’s easier to add new features later. In the future I’d keep using these steps, but also add tools that help me better understand complicated problems and plan smarter before writing any code.
